# TCSS422

Problem 1 Objectives:

1. To design, implement, and test the data structures needed to manage scheduling priority processes in the kernel of the OS.

2. To refresh your understanding of Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and their relation to object oriented design and programming.

3. To learn how to do Object Oriented Programming in C.

Design and implement three abstract data types (ADT) used in OS scheduling. The ADTs will be developed incrementally, starting with the process control block structure and its operations. Design and implement a FIFO queue to hold pointers to various PCBs that are to be instantiated in dynamic memory. The final ADT will be for a priority queue that will use multiple instantiations of the FIFO queues.


Problem 2 Objective:

To design, implement, and test a scheduling simulation (with context switching) using the Round Robin algorithm and the data structures/methods previously developed.

Design a scheduler that only implements the round robin algorithm.
